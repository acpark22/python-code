# a simple func named greet_user() that prints a greeting
# def to inform Pyt that youre defining a func. This is the func 'definition' which tells Pyt the name of the func and if applicable, what kind of info the func needs to do its job. The parantheses hold that info.
# any indented lines that follow def greet_users(): make up the body of the func. the text on line 2 is a docstring, which describes what the func does.they are enclosed in triple quotes.
# line 3 is the only code in the body of func, so greet_user() has just one job, print("Hello!")
# when you want to use func, you call it by writing the name of the func, followed by any necessary info in the parantheses- line 5
